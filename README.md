## About the Project
takeNotes is a locally hosted project that allows the user to add, read and delete notes. The front end was defined by SMU Coding Boot Camp as were various other documents in order to require students of the Boot Camp to learn how to build development approaches based on factors that they have no control over.

## Getting Started

        This project requires node modules, if these are not present, you will need to use `npm init` to retrieve them.
        The cli.js file must be run in order to host the project locally, this file requires express and path.
        Open takeNotes in your favorite code editor or terminal/console and make sure your commands will be associated with the correct file location.
    Installation:
        If you do not have node_modules included in your download, type the following into the terminal...
